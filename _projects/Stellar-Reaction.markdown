Stellar Reaction is a C++ project created by [Leon Frickensmith](https://github.com/Strikerklm96) that my group worked to develop as part of our CS 428 course in Software Engineering.

The game is similar to that in the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) genre where you control different ships that fight to capture resources in space battles. You can improve your ship by earning money through the game's objectives and buying specific pieces. The game features a number of different weapons and abilities for your ship as well as an AI to allow for multiplayer conditions in a singleplayer environment.

As part of this project, I helped to develop some of the features of the game and also learned the 'Extreme Programming' (XP) software engineering methodology. I helped create and maintain a ongoing progress log of the project as well as create tickets for issues and submit pull requests. 

Unfortunately, as the project is still under development, the Github repository is private currently. But, if the game ever becomes open source, the project can be found [here.](https://github.com/Strikerklm96/StellarReaction)
