Development of any project takes time, dedication, effort, and a little bit of luck. I include luck because all the time, dedication and effort doesn't mean anything if you aren't in a position to leverage that towards 'Progress'.

Progress is so enticing for many developers nowadays. There exists the question in my mind whether Progress is always 'progressive', or regressive. If one thinks about the nature of things, they come to realize that circumstances can be better or worse; but, sometimes for the position one finds themself in, things can only be so good or so bad. What's important though, is to recognize when Progress is driving a project towards a higher high through a bit of regression rather than working against itself.

Sometimes, when we push towards Progress, we have to make some regressions in order to change our perspective or to break from limitations of the current circumstance. However, that Progress is muddled by the nature of progress through regression, and much of the time, it can lead us to move backwards rather than forwards.

Everyone wants to reach the global maxima, but not everything can be the best it can be, as it were. It is important to be okay with something being the best it can be, for its circumstance. The grass may be greener at the global maximum, but you'll have to climb a great ways in order to reach it. 

And sometimes, good enough is just good enough.
