<p>FlashLearn is a small app that I am developing as an attempt to learn more about Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages.</p>

<p><img src="/images/projects/FlashLearn.jpg" /></p>

<p>The app is a simple tool to use to learn the kana (hiragana and katakana); I plan on adding kanji for Japanese, as well as features for learning Korean alphabet and syllable and Chinese characters and radicals.</p>

<p>This app will also be a tool for me to become more proficient with Android and building a project from start to finish.</p>
