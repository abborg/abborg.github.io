FlashLearn is a small app that I am developing as an attempt to learn more about Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages.

The app is a simple tool to use to learn the kana (hiragana and katakana); I plan on adding kanji for Japanese, as well as features for learning Korean alphabet and syllable and Chinese characters and radicals.

This app will also be a tool for me to become more proficient with Android and building a project from start to finish.
