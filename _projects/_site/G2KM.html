<p>G2KM is a small project Iâ€™ve been working on to create a piece of software that allows users to use their gamepads to control their keyboard and mouse on their computer. Through the use of different Windows API, I hope to make it simpler to switch between gaming and normal computer use with a gamepad.</p>

<p>The project is written in C# and utilizes the Windows messaging API along with the RawInput and DirectInput APIs.</p>
