<p>Foodtime was a project developed for CS465, User Interface Design, and hosted on Github, <a href="http://www.github.com/kmangutov/foodtime">here.</a></p>

<p>The app was created to allow users to connect with their friends and organizing meeting times with an easy-to-use interface. The design was focused around a widget that we called the ‘Timebar’. It was a simple element that would overlay the availability of multiple different users to allow the owners of the meeting to decide on the meeting time that best suited the group.</p>

<p>My part on the project was to develop some of the design-oriented aspects of the Timebar and to design the project poster as well as some of the materials used in the process of creating the project.</p>
