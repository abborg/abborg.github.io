This blog is a place for me to discuss things that I think are important, interesting, or frustrating. I may talk about work, personal projects, ideas, or many other topics.

I hope to be able to populate this blog with interesting and novel discussions that help others or just share my opinions on things. If you would like to learn about my projects and experience, check out my other blog posts, [projects](/projects) page, and [about](/about) section.

If you're interested in learning more about me or my work, shoot me an email at [andrew.b.borg@gmail.com](mailto:andrew.b.borg@gmail.com).
