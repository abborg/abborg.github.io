Nocturna is a game idea I've been developing for a several months now. Through this project I hope to learn how to use the Unreal Engine 4 as well as develop a piece of game software. The game will be written in C++ using the UE4 engine and will heavily utilize the engine's blueprint and scripting systems.

The project is still in its preliminary stages currently and may never go very far.
