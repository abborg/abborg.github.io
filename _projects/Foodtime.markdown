Foodtime was a project developed for CS465, User Interface Design, and hosted on Github, [here.](http://www.github.com/kmangutov/foodtime)

The app was created to allow users to connect with their friends and organizing meeting times with an easy-to-use interface. The design was focused around a widget that we called the 'Timebar'. It was a simple element that would overlay the availability of multiple different users to allow the owners of the meeting to decide on the meeting time that best suited the group.

My part on the project was to develop some of the design-oriented aspects of the Timebar and to design the project poster as well as some of the materials used in the process of creating the project.
