 The Lotor Keyboard is a project that I've been working on for the past year or so. The idea behind the keyboard is a interface that suits my needs as a programmer, normal computer user, and computer gamer. The form factor that I developed for the keyboard is based upon the Ortholinear style of keyboards that you can learn more about [here](http://www.ortholinearkeyboards.com) and [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/olkb)

 The design for the case, PCB, cover, and layout were designed and developed by me. You can learn more about them at my Github page for the project, [here.](http://www.github.com/abborg/keyboard)
